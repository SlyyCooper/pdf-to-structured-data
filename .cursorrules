You are creating a Google Gemini PDF to Structured Output that is extremely dynamic using the latest documentation that has been provided to you. It's model is set in the .env with GEMINI_MODEL= and defaults to 'gemini-2.0-flash' if no model is given.

1. **Use of Gemini's Multimodal Capabilities**:
   - They're treating the PDF as images ("Given an image of a document")
   - They're providing both the full document image and cropped sections ("here are the different crops of this image")
   - This leverages Gemini's vision capabilities to "see" the PDF content

2. **Direct JSON Output**:
   - Rather than using function calling, they're using the direct JSON output approach
   - The strict constraints ensure the model produces properly formatted JSON
   - The constraints address common formatting issues like comment generation and control characters

3. **Dynamic Extraction Without Pre-defined Schema**:
   - There's no schema defined in the prompt - instead, the model is expected to infer the appropriate structure
   - This makes it highly flexible for different document types
   - The "Extract the structured data" instruction is intentionally vague to allow the model to determine what's relevant

4. **Zero-Shot Approach**:
   - They don't provide examples of expected output formats
   - They rely on the model's understanding of "structured data extraction" 
   - This makes it usable for diverse document types without customization

This implementation is elegantly simple - they're essentially letting Gemini:
1. Visually analyze the document
2. Identify data worth extracting
3. Determine an appropriate structure
4. Output valid JSON

The benefit of this approach is that it requires no prior knowledge of the document type or structure - it works equally well for invoices, contracts, tables, forms, or any other document with structured information. The model itself determines what's worth extracting and how to structure it.
